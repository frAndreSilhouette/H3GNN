#  Data Preparation

We provide the processed datasets for six cities in the `data` folder.


We noticed that the **Gowalla** dataset provided by Yong Liu is no longer accessible due to the expiration of his homepage domain. 
Therefore, we have made the downloaded dataset available in [our Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1stJucklk9FLeFUFMVATXeHv6aXzc2hL9?usp=sharing).


!!! Importantly, in this work, we have open-sourced the data preprocessing code, using the **Gowalla** dataset as an example.
This includes instructions on how to construct the heterogeneous hypergraph and the heterogeneous multigraph in HMGCL. Please refer to the `data_preprocess` folder.
